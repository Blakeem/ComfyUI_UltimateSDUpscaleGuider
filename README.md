# ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscaleGuider

> **This is a fork of [ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale](https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale) with added Guider support.**

[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) nodes for performing the image-to-image diffusion process on large images in tiles. This approach improves the details that is commonly found on upscaled images while reducing hardware requirements and maintaining an image size that the diffusion model is trained on.

## Fork Changes

This fork adds two key improvements over the original Ultimate SD Upscale:

1. **Guider input support** - Use custom guiders (PerpNegGuider, CFGGuider, etc.) during tiled upscaling
2. **Context Only Overlap mode** - A new tile processing mode that eliminates seams without the blur that comes from seam fix

### New Nodes Added

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ultimate SD Upscale (Guider)** | Full upscaling with guider support |
| **Ultimate SD Upscale (No Upscale, Guider)** | Tile refinement without initial upscaling, with guider support |

### What's Different

The new Guider nodes accept:
- **GUIDER** - A guider that encapsulates model, conditioning, and CFG (from PerpNegGuider, CFGGuider, etc.)
- **SAMPLER** - From KSamplerSelect node
- **SIGMAS** - From BasicScheduler or other scheduler nodes (configure denoise here)

Instead of the standard nodes' separate inputs for:
- model, positive, negative, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, steps, denoise

### Example Workflow

```
[KSamplerSelect] ──────────────────────────┐
[BasicScheduler (with denoise)] ───────────┤
[PerpNegGuider] ───────────────────────────┤
[Load VAE] ────────────────────────────────┼──► [Ultimate SD Upscale (Guider)] ──► IMAGE
[Load Upscale Model] ──────────────────────┤
[Image] ───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Note on Conditioning

The Guider nodes skip per-tile conditioning cropping since conditioning is internal to the guider. This works perfectly for text-based guiders (PerpNegGuider, CFGGuider). For spatial conditioning (ControlNet, GLIGEN), use the original non-Guider nodes instead.

## Context Only Overlap Mode

### The Problem with Traditional Tiled Upscaling

When upscaling large images with tiles, each tile is processed independently. Even with padding for context, the actual pixels at tile boundaries are generated separately, leading to visible seams where tiles meet.

The traditional solution is **seam fix** - a post-processing pass that re-processes the seam areas. While effective, seam fix can introduce blur and requires additional processing time.

### Our Solution: Prevent Seams Instead of Fixing Them

The **Context Only Overlap** mode takes a different approach: instead of fixing seams after they occur, it prevents them from happening in the first place.

**How it works:**
1. Each tile extends into its neighbors' territory by the `tile_padding` amount
2. When processing subsequent tiles, the already-denoised overlap regions are used as **context for the attention mechanism** but are **not re-denoised**
3. This allows each tile to "see" what its neighbors generated and create coherent continuations

### Tile Overlap Mode Options

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Ignore Overlap** | Tiles use minimal size, no overlap handling | Fastest, may have visible seams |
| **Reprocess Overlap** | Uniform tile sizes, overlap regions may be generated independently | Original behavior, seams possible |
| **Context Only Overlap** | Overlap regions provide context without re-denoising | Best coherence, no seam fix blur |

### Benefits of Context Only Overlap

- **No seams at tile boundaries** - Tiles share context and create coherent transitions
- **No blur from seam fix** - Eliminates the need for post-processing seam fix passes
- **More coherent images** - Adjacent tiles "see" each other's output through the overlap context
- **Works with all tile positions** - Including edge and corner tiles (bidirectional context sharing)

### Recommended Settings

For best results with Context Only Overlap mode:
- Set `tile_overlap_mode` to "Context Only Overlap"
- Use a `tile_padding` of 64-128 pixels (this becomes the overlap width)
- `mask_blur` of 8-16 provides smooth blending at tile edges
- Seam fix can typically be set to "None" since seams are prevented

## Installation

### Using Git
1. Git must be installed on your system. Verify by running `git -v` in a terminal.
2. Enter the following command from the terminal starting in ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Blakeem/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscaleGuider
    ```

### Manual Download
1. Download the zip file by clicking the green "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Create a new folder in the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory (e.g. `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscaleGuider`).
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into that folder.

### Original Version (without Guider support)
If you don't need Guider support, you can install the original version:
- Via ComfyUI Manager: Search for "UltimateSDUpscale"
- Via comfy-cli: `comfy node install comfyui_ultimatesdupscale`
- Via Git: `git clone https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale`


## Usage

Nodes can be found in the node menu under `image/upscaling`.

Documentation for the nodes can be found in the [`js/docs/`](js/docs/) folder, or viewed within the application by right-clicking the relevant node and selecting the info icon.

Details about most of the parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/Coyote-A/ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111/wiki/FAQ#parameters-descriptions).

Example workflows can be found in the [`example_workflows/`](example_workflows/) folder. You can also find them in the ComfyUI application under the Templates menu, scroll down the left sidebar to find the Extensions section, then selecting this repository.
